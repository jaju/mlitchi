the logo signifies the power of ML. Hallucinating both logo as well as spelling. One on request, and another against wish. We'll stick with this, to keep reminding us of that itch continuously, asymptotically reaching our goal of the AGI, while never touching it maybe...

This is a WIP section.

A key purpose of this codebase/repository is to enable exploratory coding, and for me no other environment comes closer to what Clojure provides. Using [[https://babashka.org/][babashka]]'s nifty [[https://github.com/babashka/pods][pod]] system, and Python's reach in the ML world, I am looking to make the Clojure experience a tad bit useful in this space.

Here's code from [[file:src/mlitchi/core.clj][mlitchi/core.clj]].
#+begin_src clojure
(ns mlitchi.core
  (:require [babashka.pods :as pods]))

(def pod-file "./mlitchi/pod.py")

(defn load-pod [pod-file]
  (pods/load-pod pod-file))

(defn unload-pod [pod-file]
  (pods/unload-pod pod-file))

(defn reload-pod [pod-file]
  (unload-pod pod-file)
  (load-pod pod-file))

(comment

  (reload-pod pod-file)

  (py.hf-api/hf-hub-url "facebook/bart-large" "config.json")

  (->> "I am going to Mumbai this Saturday."
       py.spacy/nlp)

  (->> "I am going to Navi Mumbai in my car this Sunday."
       py.spacy/nlp-noun-chunks)
  )
#+end_src

Here's output during a REPL session
#+begin_src clojure
(reload-pod pod-file)
=> #:pod{:id "py.mlitchi"}
(->> "I am going to Navi Mumbai in my car this Sunday."
       py.spacy/nlp-noun-chunks)
=>
{:noun_chunks [{:text "I", :root "I", :root_dep "nsubj", :root_head "going"}
               {:text "Navi Mumbai", :root "Mumbai", :root_dep "pobj", :root_head "to"}
               {:text "my car", :root "car", :root_dep "pobj", :root_head "in"}]}
(reload-pod pod-file)
=> #:pod{:id "py.mlitchi"}
(->> "I am going to Navi Mumbai in my car this Sunday."
       py.spacy/nlp-noun-chunks)
=>

 {:text "Navi Mumbai", :root "Mumbai", :root_dep "pobj", :root_head "to"}
 {:text "my car", :root "car", :root_dep "pobj", :root_head "in"}]
#+end_src
